  title: [Evaluation of a Verifiable DBMS (Database Management System)],
  abstract: [Verifiable database management systems (verifiable DBMSs) aim to provide cryptographic guarantees about the correctness of query answers, allowing users to independently verify the integrity of the underlying data and computations. The PETALL project, developed in collaboration with INCM and awarded under the IN3+ innovation initiative, proposes a set of components that enable such verifiability through zero-knowledge techniques. This work presents an experimental evaluation of these components by integrating them into a prototype application designed for an energy community scenario. Our goal is to assess the suitability, limitations, and practical usability of the PETALL verifiable DBMS when applied to real-world application development. Through this case study, we analyze system behavior, data immutability constraints, adversarial considerations, and user interaction requirements. The results highlight both the potential and the challenges of adopting verifiable DBMS technologies, offering insights into their maturity and applicability in practice.
